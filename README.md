# Large Language Models

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks showcasing example projects based on large language models (LLMs). LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate and understand text. They are trained on massive amounts of text data, and can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

* Text generation: LLMs can be used to generate creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
* Translation: LLMs can be used to translate text from one language to another.
* Question answering: LLMs can be used to answer questions in a comprehensive and informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.
* Code summarization: LLMs can be used to summarize code in a way that is easy to understand.
* Code generation: LLMs can be used to generate code from natural language descriptions.

**Please note** that this repository is mainly for learning and showcasing purposes only. The projects are not intended to be used in production.

## Repo structure

This repository is organized into the following folders:

* **Applying_Text_Embeddings_with_VertexAI:** This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to use text embeddings to build a Q&A system and other applications using Vertex AI.
* **Dialogue_Summarization:** This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to summarize dialogue using a LLM.
* **Fine_Tuning_LLMs:** This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to fine-tune LLMs for different tasks, such as generating detoxified summaries.
* **Pair_Programming_with_LLMs:** This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use a LLM as a string template for pair programming.
